# Technology Graph
## An experiment in identifying relationships between all technologies.




### Objective
- Index all publically disclosed technologies.
- Indicate relationships between them, such as dependencies or enablers
- Create a comprehensive knowledge graph of Kevin Kelly's [Technium](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-seventh-kin/).
- Identify the interdependency between *all* technologies, as per James Burke's [Connections](https://archive.org/details/james-burke-connections_s01e01).
- Create common understanding about the *definition* of technology ([[What is Technology]].
- Provide a standardized framework around which anyone can analyze the *technologial ecosystem*.
- Help non-experts undertand the *nature* of technology and its fundamental interconnectedness.

### Instructions
- Navigate the graph on the web:
	- https://envisioning.app/
	- https://publish.obsidian.md/technology-graph/
- Download Vault on Github and navigate it in Obsidian:
	- https://github.com/envisioning/technology-graph/ 
	- https://obsidian.md/
- Recommended starting points:
	- [[Agriculture]]
	- [[Internet]] 
	- [[3G Mobile Network]] 
	- [[Gartner Hype Cycle 2021]] #Index 
	- [[WEF Emerging Tech 2020]] #Index 
	- [[Wikipedia List of Emerging Technologies]] #Index 
	- [[Apple iPhone 12 Pro (2020)]] #Product 

---

### Collaboration
- Feel free to create new Technologies entries to the main branch.
- Also consider adding Obsidian \[[Links\]] between existing Technologies.
- For all new Entires, please indicate at least one Relationship and Source.

### Tags
- #Method - how technology is done.
- #Application - what technology is used for.
- #Index - lists of technologies from external sources.
- #Product - technology stack of known products.
- #Technology - deprecated.

### ToDo
- [ ] Define taxonomy for Relationships:
	- Currently indicating enabling technologies.
	- Ex: [[Gasoline]] enables [[Carburetor]] enables [[Internal Combustion Engine]] enables [[Automobile]].
- [ ] Unambigously define what is meant by *technology*:
	- [[What is Technology]]
- [ ] Clearly define how the scope of this graph is different from Wikipedia.
- [ ] [Automate Wikipedia import of entries & relationships](https://github.com/envisioning/technology-graph/pull/1) @felipescb
- [ ] Determine long-term solution for funding & maintaining research initative.
- [ ] Validate research approach with subject-area experts.
	- [ ] Domain experts.
	- [ ] Data & network experts.
- [x] Eliminate Domain taxonomy and replace it with connections between Technologies.
- [ ] Eliminate #Technology tag and replace it with #Application or #Method 
- [ ] Organize related non-technological entities:
	- [x] #Product 
	- [ ] Organizations
	- [ ] People
	- [ ] 118 Chemical Elements
	- [ ] Nation States
- [ ] Improve Technology entry quality:
	- [ ] Eliminate Orphans (unlinked entries)
	- [ ] Standardize approach to indicate year of invention.
	- [ ] Apply taxonomy/tags to all entries.
	- [ ] Add external sources to all entries.
	- [ ] Add links to Wikidata.
	- [ ] Add links to Envisioning TDB.
