# Technology Graph

## An experiment in identifying relationships between technologies.



### Objective
- Index all publically disclosed technologies.
- Indicate relationships between them, such as dependencies or enablers
- Create a comprehensive knowledge graph of Kevin Kelly's [Technium](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-seventh-kin/).
- Identify the interdependency between *all* technologies, as per James Burke's [Connections](https://archive.org/details/james-burke-connections_s01e01).
- Provide a standardized framework around which anyone can analyze the *technologial ecosystem*.
- Help non-experts undertand the *nature* of technology and its fundamental interconnectedness.
- Publish research findings on [GitHub](https://github.com/mz-000/TG).

---

### Instructions
- Navigate the research by loading this repository locally in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- Either [download the Vault](https://github.com/mz-000/TG/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a ZIP File or install a GitHub client on your Computer.

### Collaboration
- Feel free to create new Technologies entries to the main branch.
- Also consider adding \[[ Links \]] between existing Technologies.
- For all new Entires, please indicate at least one Relationship and Source.

---

### ToDo
- [ ] Apply taxonomy (Tags) to all entries.
- [ ] Add sources to all entries.
- [ ] Create taxonomy for Relationships (currently indicating dependencies and enabling technologies).
- [ ] Unambigously definie what is meant by *technology*.
- [ ] Unambigously define how the scope of this graph is different from Wikipedia.
- [ ] Validate research approach with subject-area experts.
	- [ ] Domain experts.
	- [ ] Data & network experts.
- [ ] Determine long-term solution for funding & maintaining research initative.
- [ ] Eliminate #Domain taxonomy and replace it with connections between Technologies.
- [ ] Eliminate #Technology tag and replace it with #Application or #Method 
- [ ] Unambigously distinguish #Application from #Method.

---

### Tags
- #Method - how technology is done.
- #Application - what technology is used for.
- #Technology (deprecated)
- #Domain (deprecated)
