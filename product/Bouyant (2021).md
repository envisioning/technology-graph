[[Cargo Airship]]

> Buoyant developed a “hybrid” battery [[Electric Airship]], meaning that it generates around 70% of its lift using [[lighter-than-air gas]] — in this case, [[Helium]]. The remaining 30% of the lift comes from its [[tilt-rotor architecture]]. 

> the ultimate aim is to build an airship that’s capable of delivering up to 650 pounds of cargo at a cruise speed of around 60 miles per hour.
