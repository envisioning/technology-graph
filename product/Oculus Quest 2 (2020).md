Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality (VR) headset created by Oculus, a brand of Facebook. It is the successor to the Oculus Quest.[3][4] It was announced at Facebook Connect 7 and shipped on October 13, 2020.

As with its predecessor, the Quest 2 is capable of running as both a standalone headset with an internal, Android-based operating system, and with Oculus-compatible VR software running on a desktop computer when connected over USB or Wi-Fi. It is a refresh of the original Oculus Quest with a similar design, but with a lighter weight, updated internal specifications, a display with a higher refresh rate and per-eye resolution, and updated Oculus Touch controllers.

The Quest 2 received mostly positive reviews as an incremental update to the Quest, but some of its changes faced criticism, including its strap, reduced interpupillary distance (IPD) options, and a new requirement for users to log in with a Facebook account to use the headset and Oculus services.

Hardware

Its design is similar to the original Oculus Quest, but replacing the black, cloth-covered exterior with white-colored plastic and a black face pad. It is lighter than the first-generation Quest, at 503 grams (17.7 ounces) in comparison to 571 grams (20.1 ounces).[5] The strap was changed to a fabric-based version (rather than the elastic-based strap of the Quest),[6] while the power button was relocated to the side of the headset, instead of the original's more forward facing one.

The Quest 2 utilizes the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 system-on-chip (which is part of a Snapdragon product line designed primarily for VR and augmented reality devices),[7] with 6 GB of RAM — an increase of 2 GB over the first-generation model.[5]

Its display is a singular fast-switch LCD panel with a 1832×1920 per eye resolution, which can run at a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz (an increase from 1440×1600 per-eye at 72 Hz). The headset includes physical interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustment at 58 mm, 63 mm and 68 mm, adjusted by physically moving the lenses into each position. This is also combined with software adjustment.[8]

The included Oculus Touch controllers are slightly bigger, influenced by the original Oculus Rift's controllers.[9] Their battery life has also been increased four-fold over the controllers included with the first-generation Quest.[10][6]
Games
Main article: List of Oculus Quest games

Unlike the original Oculus Quest, the Oculus Quest 2 is not backwards compatible with Oculus Go apps and games.[11] It does, however, support all games and software made for the first-generation model, and existing titles can be updated to support higher graphical quality on Quest 2.[6]
Accessories

Oculus presented an "Elite Strap" accessory, which contains a ring-like pad for the back of the head and a tightness dial, along with a variant with a battery pack built into the strap.[6] Oculus is also promoting Logitech headphones "certified" for Quest 2 (including the G333 VR, the company's first in-ear headphones model), which have shortened cords designed for use with VR headsets.[12]

In addition, Oculus partnered with Logitech to support their K830 keyboard as part of the "Infinite Office" feature, allowing the keyboard to be detected and displayed within a virtual reality environment.[13]
Release

The Quest 2 was officially unveiled on September 16, 2020 during Facebook Connect 7. The 64 GB model was priced at US$299, a $100 decrease over the original Quest model. The 128 GB model of the first-generation Quest was replaced by a 256 GB model at US$399.[14] While announcing the Quest 2, Facebook also announced the upcoming release of Oculus Move, a fitness tracking software to be included with the device.[15]

Originally a standalone device only, the Quest 2 was later added functionality that allowed it to serve as a headset for PC VR gaming. First in the form of Oculus Link, a functionality that allows it to work connected to a PC via USB cable. Oculus provided its own Link cable, but the funcionality doesn't depend on the use of such specific cable. Later came Oculus Air link, a similar functionality, currently in beta, which allows the headset to be used on a PC wirelessly via Wi-Fi, being able to take advantage of the headset's Wi-Fi 6 connectivity.

Also, the headset having 72 Hz as its default refresh rate, initially 90 Hz refresh rate was made available as an experimental feature only on the Oculus Home environment. Then support for 90 Hz within games added via a software update in November 2020.[5][9][16] On April 23, 2021, a new software update (v28) introduced optional experimental support for 120 Hz in games.[2] Later 120 Hz was enabled for Oculus Link, and later for Oculus Air Link.[citation needed]

Additionally, the headset was added hand tracking via its cameras, which is used in supported games, and also allows the headset's menus to be operated without requiring controllers.

On July 23, 2021, it was announced that the latest version of the Quest 2 SDK included the ability to develop augmented reality applications.[17]
Reception

The Verge was positive in a pre-release review, noting that while it lacked standout features, it did have "worthwhile" improvements such as reduced weight, a screen with a better visual appearance and refresh rate than the original Quest, and a re-located USB port. The new strap was panned for having "less support and a slightly clumsier tightening mechanism" (partly rectified by the Elite Strap accessory sold separately), and the new IPD mechanism was considered "annoying" and not as inclusive as that of the first-generation model. In conclusion, it was argued that while it was not a "must-upgrade" for existing owners, the Quest 2 had "the best overall balance of hardware, features, and price."[18]

Ars Technica was less positive, noting that its internal speakers were "noticeably crisper and louder", but panning the new cloth strap in comparison to the original Quest's elastic straps (and arguing that it alone was responsible for the claimed reduction in weight), the limited IPD options, worse battery life, and the controllers having less grip and reduced accuracy on more intensive games. The switch from OLED to LCD was shown to produce "crisper" images but more "washed out" color.[6]
Criticism

Virtual reality headsets have been linked to rising cases of rashes, swelling, burning, itching, hives, and bumps.[19] On 27 July 2021, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Health Canada have coordinated a recall of Facebook's Oculus Quest 2 after 5,716 reports of facial skin irritation were reported with 45 cases requiring medical attention.[20][21] Despite complaints issued by consumers such as swollen painful itchy eyes being reported as early as October 2020, the recall only occurred in July 2021.[22][23] Facebook did not halt Oculus sales immediately citing data that only "0.01% of people using Quest 2" had serious allergic reactions and dermatological and toxicological reports came out negative for contaminants that could be causing the swollen painful rashes upon skin contact. Facebook doesn't know the origin of this reaction and instead they sent a free silicone cover to cover the allergic user's faces.[24][22] Over four million Oculus head sets have been recalled.[19] The Quest 2 faced criticism over the mandate that Facebook accounts be used on it and all future Oculus products.[18][6] It was reported that some users were unable to use the headset due to their Facebook account being suspended. Some described that linking their deactivated Facebook account to the device rendered the headset a "paperweight".[25][26][27] In September 2020 Facebook paused the sale of its VR headsets in Germany after it faced criticism from the German Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) for requiring its users to have valid Facebook accounts before covering their head with the Oculus.[28][29]
