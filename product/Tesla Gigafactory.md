TRIC built high-pressure natural gas lines to its sites, but Tesla decided to use electricity and not connect natural gas to Gigafactory.[82] Heat pump technology is used for heating,[83][84] and a $6.8 million hot water storage tank with 10 million gallons is used to balance heat.[79][52] In 2014 Navigant estimated 100 MW electricity delivery which could be supplied (on average) by nearby [[wind turbines]] and [[roof solar panels]],[85] whereas a former Tesla logistics manager in 2016 estimated 300 MW to produce 35 GWh of battery capacity per year.[86] Tesla installed solar panels on the roof in early 2018,[87][88] to eventually reach 70 MW[89] from 200,000 solar panels.[90]

Tesla works with a mining company to extract [[lithium]] 200 miles (320 km) to the southeast, at Silver Peak in Esmeralda County. They intend to process the underground [[brine water]] industrially over hours rather than the traditional way of letting the water evaporate from ponds over a year.[47][91]

Panasonic was expected to begin cell production in 2016,[108] and continue for at least 10 years.[123] Among the machines spotted at the opening in July 2016 were presses and rollers for cathodes.[124] Gigafactory began mass production of 21700 cells in January 2017.[15][114] Only Panasonic cells are to be used in the US-made Model 3,[125] and Tesla uses 21â€“70 format for Model 3 and Powerwall/Powerpack.[114] Panasonic owns some of the cell production equipment[123] in an area not accessible to others. By December 2018, Panasonic operated 11 cell production lines.[107] Some of the lines were temporarily converted from storage (NMC) to vehicle (NCA) to increase supply for the Model 3.[126]

Tesla uses nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) lithium cells for stationary storage (Powerwall and Powerpack), and nickel cobalt aluminium (NCA) lithium cells for vehicles.[127] The cell components are then encased in aluminum cans made by Heitkamp & Thumann inside GF1,[128][107] using 10,000 tons per year.[129] An April 2019 report quoting former and current employees at Panasonic's side of the Gigafactory described how half a million of battery cells per day were scrapped because of production defects related to carelessness, lack of respect for operating procedures, and the overall pressure to increase output.[130][131][132] Panasonic delivered three million battery cells daily to Tesla in 2018.[107] At the end of 2019, Panasonic had 3000 US workers and 200 Japanese technicians at Gigafactory 1,[131] quality had improved to increase production to a rate of 30 GWh/year on the same equipment. Panasonic occupies more than half of the factory.[132] 

The basis of the early Tesla products are lithium-ion cells in the 18650 form factor. These cylindrical cells have a diameter of 18 mm and are 65 mm in length, a size originally used for the batteries of laptop computers. They are used in Model S and X, and Powerwall 1.

In October 2015, Tesla moved the Tesla Powerwall and Powerpack production from its Fremont factory to the Gigafactory. The Tesla Powerwall has been produced in the finished portion since the third quarter of 2015.[95] 2170-cells are transferred on autonomous vehicles from Panasonic to Tesla, where workers and robots assemble cells into packs using bandoliers, cooled by tubes made onsite by Valeo.[107][133] Drive units (motor and gearbox) for Model 3 are made with 90% automation.[107]
