[[Shipping Container]]


> Quick-to-install amphibious structures made of adapted shipping containers designed to resist high sea levels, storms, and floods. Able to move along the city waterside, this floating station can easily adapt according to the weather, fulfilling different functions.

> The containers are made of a range of materials, such as wooden pallets, wire, and thousands of recycled plastic bottles, allowing them to float and adjust when necessary. They rise up due to inner tubes' buoyancy, moving with water level rises. The containers are equipped with solar panels, providing clean energy to the structure and enabling the system to serve multiple purposes, such as housing, community kitchens, restrooms, indoor farms, and schools.
