> originated by James Colgate and Michael Peshkin at Northwestern University in 1996. From [their homepage](https://peshkin.mech.northwestern.edu/cobot/), a cobot is a robot for direct physical interaction with a human user, within a shared workspace.

> The [cobots patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5952796) makes the supporting role clearer: cobots guide, redirect, or steer motions that originate with the person.
