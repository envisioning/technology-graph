Also known as Virtual Retinal Display (VRD) or Retinal Scan Display (RSD), this is a miniature projector mounted on [[Mixed Reality]] (MR) glasses that projects a localized light field directly onto the user’s retina. This technological solution creates an interactive mixed reality layer, with virtual 3D objects appearing to float in front of the user, similar to a [[holographic]] image, and blends digital content seamlessly with the physical world.

The MR glasses are lensless, and the tiny projectors are not placed in front of the eyes. The result is a screenless display, which might also present a larger Field of View (FOV) than [[Near-Eye Display (NED)]] technologies. This solution might also solve the challenges of current [[Augmented Reality (AR)]] glasses that have more complex optical systems, combiners, and bulky designs.

Current models present higher resolution and excellent color gamut and brightness, making it possible to use in any kind of setting, indoors or outdoors. New models include real-time pupil trackers, which could help improve Field of Depth adjustment by blurring the image that is not in focus.

The idea of projecting photons directly into someone’s retina may raise some health concerns. By exposing the eye's retina to constant light stimuli, the fluids of the eye tend to dry up, and this increases the risk of eye infection. Also, there is no one-size-fits-all; the projectors must be adequate ergonomically to the users' eye anatomy.
