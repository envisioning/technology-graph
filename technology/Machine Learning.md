[[Neural Processing Unit (NPU)]]


A branch of Artificial Intelligence focused on developing applications or models that learn from data and enhance their performance and accuracy over time without being programmed to do so. Algorithms are trained with large amounts of data with the goal to make decisions and predictions by looking at new data. The training data is labeled to bring attention to features and classifications that a certain model will need to identify. Then, unlabeled data is presented to the model for autonomous classification, which helps to improve its accuracy. Machine Learning is widely used on digital assistants, personalized recommendations, autonomous vehicles, and robots.
