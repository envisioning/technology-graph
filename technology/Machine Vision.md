[[Object Detection]]


A method through which a computer digitizes an image, processes the data and takes some type of automated action. Machine Vision allows systems to understand and interpret the environment using live or recorded images, tag their content, and enable programs to perform automated tasks that previously required human supervision. By using one or more video cameras with analog-to-digital conversion and signal processing, a computer or robot controller receives the image data. This also allows systems to perceive their surroundings beyond regular electromagnetic wavelengths and might include infrared, ultraviolet, or X-ray frequencies to enhance image processing precision.
