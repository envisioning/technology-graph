SOURCE Hydropanels produce high-quality, potable water using only sunlight and air, to provide sustainable drinking water for industrial, commercial, residential and community applications. As part of its PBC charter, SOURCE formalizes its commitment to technology specifically built for social equity, with a focus on solving one of humanityâ€™s greatest challenges: ensuring people in all geographies and economic status have access to the same high quality drinking water. As a case in point, in Bahia Hondita, Colombia, the company installed 156 SOURCE Hydropanels to bring renewable water to more than 300 residents of the Wayuu Tribe eliminating the six-mile daily journey to haul clean water.
