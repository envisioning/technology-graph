Monetary economics is the branch of economics which analyses the functions of money. [[Storage of value]] is one of the three generally accepted functions of money. The other functions are the [[medium of exchange]], which is used as an intermediary to avoid the inconveniences of the coincidence of wants, and the [[unit of account]], which allows the value of various goods, services, assets and liabilities to be rendered in multiples of the same unit. Money is well-suited to storing value because of its purchasing power. It is also useful because of its durability.
