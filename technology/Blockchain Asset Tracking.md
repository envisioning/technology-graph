#Method

It is possible to track the movement of goods from raw materials to the end consumer (and even in circular economies) and keep reliable digital records of an asset's origin, characteristics, and ownership. For this to take place, a smart contract is deployed to a local [[hyperledger]] fabric network via a [[blockchain]] platform. As the asset is moving along the supply chain, it is scanned via [[RFID]] or [[barcode]] by [[IoT devices]], which publishes an [[event notification]] to the blockchain platform. The platform then notifies all applications involved in the process that the scan has taken place. An application listening to the platform then invokes a transfer action, which automatically updates the asset's location in the [[Distributed Ledger]].
