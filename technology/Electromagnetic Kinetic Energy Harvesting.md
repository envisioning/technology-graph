#Method 



A kinetic energy harvesting method that uses [[Electromagnetic Induction]] and inverse magnetostrictive effects to transform motion into energy. By applying a bias magnetic field using permanent magnets, a material's magnetization state is induced. Then, a strain is applied to this material, generating a change in magnetic flux, which is converted into [[Electric Power]] using a coil.
