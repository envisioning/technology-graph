#Method 


One of the most used ways to define, quantify, and characterize the within-field variability in crop production. It is accomplished by combining geospatial data with real-time information from yield monitors mounted on combine harvesters. Variables such as mass, volume, and moisture are collected, allowing to observe both spatial and temporal yield variation within a field, helping farmers decide which parts of the area need more water or fertilizers.
