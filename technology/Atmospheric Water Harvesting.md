#Method 

By pulling moisture from the air, this water harvesting method can convert humidity into drinkable water. It functions either by extracting water droplets from coated filaments or using [[water-attracting metal-organic devices]] to extract water from the atmosphere. Vapor can be harvested by sandwiching a layer of water-attracting metal-organic elements between a black painted surface. This method is efficient because it captures more water and requires lower regeneration temperatures for its release compared to other sorbents. Generally, a system of this kind can produce three liters of water per day for every kilogram of metal-organic material. The approach promises to enable access to clean drinking water in low-humidity areas or zones lacking access to water resources. In agriculture, for instance, crops in arid regions would be irrigated with water coming from the atmosphere.
