[[Alcoholic Beverage]]

Three categories divide alcoholic beverages: wine, beer, and spirits. Wines are produced through fermentation; beers are brewed and then fermented, and spirits are fermented and distilled. Germinated grain can be dried, milled, and steeped in heated water, thereby producing a cereal mash to which yeast and other ingredients are added.

The process causes fermentation as it consumes the plant sugars, converting them to carbon dioxide and ethanol (alcohol). The method of heating and condensation can also distill the alcohol. Fermented liquids are heated, allowing the resulting vapor to condense when subjected to a cooling mechanism. Lastly, the composition can be copper stilled, resulting in fermented leftovers free of alcohol residues.

Recent research shows that the waste from the alcohol-making process, known as DDGS (dried distillers' grains with solids), especially DDGS from the Scotch malt whiskey industry, can be used for animal feed applications. At the same time, winery wastes have been demonstrable as viable sources of bioactive compounds and new polymeric biocomposites as colorants, antioxidant or antimicrobial agents, while gin production can be transformed to formulate sustainable skincare ingredients for lasting hydration and moisturiÂ­zation.
