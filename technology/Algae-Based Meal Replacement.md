Meal replacements formed from algae that contain a controlled quantity of calories and nutrients designed to substitute traditional solid food meals. Algae are the fastest growing plant organisms in nature and are a great alternative source of vitamins, proteins, and minerals. Algae have a lot of potential as a scalable food source, as they grow anywhere – often in vertical fermentation tanks – without using large amounts of land or water. In current experiments, lab-grown algal-based food shows no negative impact on the environment, nor residual waste discharged into the ecosystem.

Producing food today puts an incredible amount of stress on the environment. Besides, difficulty accessing nutritious food contributes to the growing rate of obesity or inadequate nutrition. Given that traditional approaches were not capable of satisfactorily mitigating the problem of global food insecurity, researchers and many actors, along with the food supply chain, believe that artificial, lab-grown food could efficiently ensure appropriate nutrition for everyone on the planet.
