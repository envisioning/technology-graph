#Method 


This machine learning method uses different algorithms to learn at multiple levels of representation and abstraction, helping to make sense of complex data such as images, sound, and text. It uses artificial neural networks to progressively extract higher-level information from the raw input. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep Learning is applied in computer vision, machine vision, speech recognition, machine translation, and other areas to increase machine comprehension for inputted data.
