#Method 

A recycling method, in which non-recycled mixed [[Plastic]] from municipal solid waste are chemically transformed into synthetic crude oil that can be re-refined into polymers, waxes, heating oil, gasoline, or diesel fuel. This type of chemical recycling uses heat and different chemical combinations to reduce plastics to their original monomer form so that they can eventually be processed (re-polymerized). Pyrolysis involves two major processes: thermal or catalytic pyrolysis. Thermal pyrolysis is simply heating Polyethylene at high pressure, which breaks down the polymer backbone forming smaller organic molecules. Catalytic pyrolysis uses a catalyst to reduce the temperature and reaction time, improving its economic viability. The downside of pyrolysis is that no current technique can process all types of plastic simultaneously, such as black plastic. Also, recent discoveries show that it releases toxic substances into the environment, which current research is attempting to solve.
