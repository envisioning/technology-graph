[[Risk Assessment]]

By tracking user habits, interests, and activities, financial advisors can provide a tailor-made service that meets and anticipates the unique, changing needs of each user. Also, by comparing offers from multiple merchants, looking the option to pay in alternative currencies, and managing user investment accounts around the clock, this technology improves financial transparency, helping customers make more informed decisions. Fraudulent transactions can be reduced by monitoring user behavioral patterns, identifying anomalies, and when necessary, immediately creating an alert.

The financial assistant uses a variety of systems and methods that could help make a purchase following user determined steps, such as suggesting alternative products, determining availability in stores, searching for the absolute lowest prices, selecting the payment method to then execute the purchase and so on. Deep Learning could help the assistant make sense of immense amounts of data, automatically tracking, pulling, and crossing-checking information from different sources to create user-tailored conclusions. Additionally, through the use of Predictive Analytics Trading, money can be automatically invested depending on market conditions, the userâ€™s available funds, and personal risk profile.
