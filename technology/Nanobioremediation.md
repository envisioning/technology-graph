#Method 
A hybrid method to remediate pollutants present in the environment, able to biosynthesize [[Biosynthesis]] nanoparticles by capturing metal ions through plants, bacteria, yeast, and fungi, and turning them into elementary non-toxic compounds through enzymes generated by cells. This bioremediation method reduces the toxicity in microorganisms while improving the microbial activity of specific toxic materials.
