The Norwegian company OceanTherm already uses their “bubble net” method to keep some of the nation’s fjords from freezing over; now, they’re proposing using it to create a roiling hurricane net, reports [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/can-a-bubble-net-stop-a-hurricane-some-norwegians-think-so/)‘s Eric Niiler.


The idea is beautifully, sublimely simple — and wildly ambitious: pump air through a submerged length of pipe between two ships, releasing an inverse-Niagara of bubbles, which stretch and surface like mighty [Jörmungandr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr), pushing up water from the ocean depths.

Hurricanes gather strength from warm water. When storms hit warm patches on the surface, they can rapidly gain strength (as [Hurricane Laura](https://www.freethink.com/articles/new-flight-simulator) did), putting people and property at risk, complicating attempts to [save lives](https://www.freethink.com/articles/how-a-video-game-is-helping-the-cajun-navy-save-lives) and creating ever more [hurricane victims](https://www.freethink.com/videos/inside-the-cajun-navy-how-volunteers-are-training-to-rescue-hurricane-victims).

But deep water tends to be colder than water near the surface. By bringing up that colder water, OceanTherm believes they may be able to cool conditions down enough to rob the cyclone of fuel.
