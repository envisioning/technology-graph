# The Legislative Recipe: Syntax for Machine-Readable Legislation
https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08678

> Legal interpretation is a linguistic venture. In judicial opinions, for example, courts are often asked to interpret the text of statutes and legislation. As time has shown, this is not always as easy as it sounds. Matters can hinge on vague or inconsistent language and, under the surface, human biases can impact the decision-making of judges. This raises an important question: what if there was a method of extracting the meaning of statutes consistently? That is, what if it were possible to use machines to encode legislation in a mathematically precise form that would permit clearer responses to legal questions? This article attempts to unpack the notion of machine-readability, providing an overview of both its historical and recent developments. The paper will reflect on logic syntax and symbolic language to assess the capacity and limits of representing legal knowledge. In doing so, the paper seeks to move beyond existing literature to discuss the implications of various approaches to machine-readable legislation. Importantly, this study hopes to highlight the challenges encountered in this burgeoning ecosystem of machine-readable legislation against existing human-readable counterparts.

# Machine-Readable and Machine-Executable Legislation: A View of the Future, from the Island of Jersey

> **Hudson Hollister:** 
That sounds quite simple. I want to ask Heather about the same concept. Heather, what do you view as the primary advantage of machine-enabled amending?

> **Heather Mason:** 
The main advantage, as far as I’m concerned, is it would save a lot of work for me and my editorial team. Because at the moment, we do all the consolidating. We consolidate the amendments into the existing legislation and  if any of the assembly members or ministers request a marked up copy to show the amendments, that is something we do manually, which is obviously quite time consuming. The idea of it being able to be generated automatically would certainly save us quite a lot of work.

# Making the law machine-readable
https://www.wavelength.law/blog/makingthelawmachinereadablepart1


> Much has been written about how artificial intelligence will change the legal profession. To-date these discussions have largely focused on tools, with text analysis capabilities, that are capable of extracting specific data elements from documents to create structured content. Tools that identify patterns in data (e.g. dates, currency values, names, images, etc.) do so by using machine learning algorithms to construct statistical models.

> In the legal sector, the main application for this text analysis capability is the creation of structured (e.g. tabular) content from unstructured or semi-structured documents (e.g. contracts). When someone uses such a tool to extract elements from a document (e.g. clauses, parties, dates, etc.), these elements are made machine-identifiable or explicit to the machine. Once extracted and ordered, in a spreadsheet or database, this data can be algorithmically analysed or transformed via encoded business rules to support a decision-making process.

> There are several examples of where this approach has been applied, ranging from due diligence activities (such as lease reviews, M&A transactions, etc.) through to classical eDiscovery and technology assisted review (TAR) processes. Undoubtedly, the smart application of these technologies has and will deliver significant efficiencies and an evolution in the way legal services are delivered.
