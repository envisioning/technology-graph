# High-Efficiency Reverse Osmosis

A [[Water Filter]] method designed to treat aggressive feed waters by handling and effectively preventing membrane scaling caused by biological matter such as oil, grease, and silicaâ€” a common issue in Reverse Osmosis (RO). In RO, when certain salts' natural saturation, such as [[Silica]], exceeds a certain level, precipitation occurs, causing scaling of the semi-permeable membranes, which are costly to replace. In High-Efficiency Reverse Osmosis, the silica solubility is exponentially boosted by increasing water's pH up to 10 or more, allowing recoveries above 90%. This process offers the operators reduced costs through less water consumption, less use of antiscalants, and less required cleaning.
