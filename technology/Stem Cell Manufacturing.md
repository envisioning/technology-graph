#Method 

A method of transforming, multiplying, and regenerating stem cell tissue through [[Bioprocessing]] tools that extract body cells and culture them in a laboratory setting. The process of manufacturing stem cells has two distinct stages. The first one is proliferation, which involves producing several cells to form larger tissues. The second, called differentiation, is focused on turning stem cells into functioning cells. New substances such as [[Hydrogel]] simplify these processes and enable scientists to achieve specific results, such as developing heart cells or motor neurons, for instance. They could support the restoration of damaged tissues and organs or be used in cell-based cellular therapies to fight against cancer and hematological disorders. These solutions could also help protect organisms from autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases and genetic disorders.
