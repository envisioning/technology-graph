[[Machine Reasoning]]

Interfaces that enable people to build unique digital friends. By taking the shape of [[Chatbot]], some have their pre-programmed personality and character design; others could aggregate data from interactions and learn to relate better with their user. By learning from several inputs such as behaviors and decisions, the AI companion could respond rationally and emotionally, store and life-log experiences, and even be able to predict the users' needs and assist in future decision-making.

Interactions with these systems may vary from texting and recording videos and voice messages to a natural conversation as well as biometric information collected via [[Wearable]], [[Skin Patch]] or [[Implant]]. All this information can be stored and processed by the algorithm to make the virtual companion reliable and non-mechanical. As language processing improves and emotional AI evolves, it could soon feel similar to a human conversation or even pass the famous Turing Test, perhaps becoming a vital part of social life.
