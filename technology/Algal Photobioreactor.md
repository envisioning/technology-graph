#Application 
[[LED Light]]

This closed-loop system works with LED lights to maximize algal growth while keeping a clean-culture operation without relying on weather changes.

Closed-loop indoors system working with LED lights, able to keep individual algae species inoculated for a clean-culture operation, thus helping enhance algae cultivation. The systems' architecture can be composed of plastic, tubular or flat-panel glass, or stainless-steel fermenter-like reactors that contain internal illumination to allow maximum light incidence. This solution aims to harness algae's potential as a cheap and efficient raw material for nutritional supplements, biofuel, animal feeds, cosmetics, water recovery, and medicine.

This closed-loop cultivation system offers accurate control over contamination and cell physiology and improves the harvest through increased plant growth and quality, despite the accompanying increase in manufacturing costs. Furthermore, if added to wastewater treatment plants, this system could harness algae's bioremediation power to eliminate a considerable amount of contaminants and, in turn, bring recycled water back into the chain.
