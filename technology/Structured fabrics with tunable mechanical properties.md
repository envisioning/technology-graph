> That work, which was published on April 7 in the journal _Science Robotics_, could be useful for remote collaboration where a physical component of the collaboration is necessary, medical devices, and haptics (which use technology to simulate physical sensation for virtual reality). Next, the team plans to miniaturize and optimize the design of both structured fabrics and smart systems to get them closer to practical applications.

> The _Nature_ paper is titled "Structured fabrics with tunable mechanical properties." The research was supported by the Foster and Coco Stanback Space Innovation Fund at Caltech, Facebook, and the Army Research Office.

> The _Science Robotics_ paper is titled "Robotic surfaces with reversible, spatiotemporal control for shape morphing and object manipulation." The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Office.
