Agriculture accounts for a considerable amount of waste from [[Plastic]] and other pollutant materials used for [[Packaging]]. However, consumers still expect their products to be protected, clean, and safe from any possible threat. This behavior over the last few decades has boosted food packaging production, and consequently, of plastic and many other pollutant materials. As an alternative, packaging made out of biocomposites represent a particularly innovative solution to substitute plastic and reduce the amount of food waste.

Bio-based coatings are made of bio-raw materials, such as [[Biogenic Scrap]], or bio-mass balance methods using [[Bionaphtha]], [[Biogas]], or even [[Natural Amino Acids]]. Currently, the agro-waste coating is a promising new coating method using agricultural byproducts and waste to extend the shelf life of fresh produce. In the form of a spray, the main component of these new lacquers is a [[Biopolymer]] resin extracted from byproducts, such as orange peels, that act as a [[Thin Film]], similar to plastic films. The bio-resin is actually cutin – a wax-like water-repellent biopolymer found in the walls of various plant cells – used to address food protection and preservation.
