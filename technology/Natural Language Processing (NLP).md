#Method 

[[Machine Learning]]


In the intersection of artificial intelligence, computer science, and linguistics, this method makes machines understand human speech in text or audio format by evaluating the meaning and significance of words while completing tasks involving syntax, morphology, semantics, and discourse. By using statistical inference algorithms, it is possible for the machine to automatically learn rules through the analysis of large sets of documents. Since human speech is not always precise and often ambiguous, NLP is key in the progress of human-machine interaction applications such as virtual assistants, automatic speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, and automatic text summarization.
