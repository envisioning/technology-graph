#Method

A 3D model-based process mounted on AI-assisted software that enables simulations from physical structures. The 3D model enables the design, simulation, and operation of what-if scenarios through virtual representations. Building Information Modelling depends on the physical and functional characteristics of real assets to provide nearly real-time simulations. The data in the model defines the design elements and establishes behaviors and relationships between model components, so every time an element is changed, visualization is updated. This allows testing different variables such as lighting, energy consumption, structural integrity, and simulating changes on the design before it is actually built. It also supports greater cost predictability, reduces errors, improves timelines, and gives a better understanding of future operations and maintenance.
