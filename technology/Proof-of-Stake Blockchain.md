An alternative consensus algorithm to the Proof-of-Work model. Proof-of-Stake relies on market incentives instead of computing power to verify transactions, thus reducing energy consumption and improving safety in a more accessible and decentralized blockchain ledger. In this implementation of blockchain technology, participants build trust by putting down a deposit or stake amount of cryptocurrency in exchange for the right to add blocks to the distributed ledger. In the Proof-of-Stake model, there are no miners but validators who mint or forge new blocks.
