#Method 

[[Machine Learning]]

A machine translation method that applies a large artificial neural network to improve the speed and accuracy of probability predictions of a sequence of words, often in the form of sentences. Different from statistical machine translation, neural machine translation trains its parts in an end-to-end basis, performing the analysis in two stages; encoding and decoding. In the encoding stage, source language text is fed into the machine then transformed into a series of linguistic vectors. The decoding stage transfers these vectors into the target language.
