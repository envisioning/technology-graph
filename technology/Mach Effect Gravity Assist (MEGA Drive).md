> A MEGA drive works like an electric toothbrush. Using [[Piezoelectric Crystal]] and applying a specific electric frequency causes the crystals to expand and contract. In turn, that makes the device vibrate. Similarly, a MEGA drive vibrates mainly in one direction, which causes it to accelerate slightly. Fearn and Woodward say this enables the device to tap into the gravitational potential of the universe.
