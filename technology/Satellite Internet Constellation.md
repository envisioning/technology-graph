# 5G from Space: An Overview of 3GPP Non-Terrestrial Networks

Abstractâ€” We provide an overview of the 3rd generation  
partnership project (3GPP) work on evolving the 5G wireless  
technology to support non-terrestrial satellite networks. Adapting  
5G to support non-terrestrial networks entails a holistic design  
spanning across multiple areas from radio access network to  
services and system aspects to core and terminals. In this article,  
we describe the main topics of non-terrestrial networks, explain in  
detail the design aspects, and share various design rationales  
influencing standardization.
