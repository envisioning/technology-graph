Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a game-changing technology that leverages the temperature difference in the ocean between cold deep water and warm surface water in the tropics and subtropics to generate unlimited energy without the use of fossil fuels. It boasts a competitive advantage over alternative sources of electricity production regarding accessibility, predictability, affordability, and emissions.


### HOW IT WORKS

Eighty percent of the sun’s solar energy is absorbed into the surface of the world’s oceans, and it is replenished daily regardless of weather patterns. In a closed cycle OTEC system, water flows through a large pipe and heat exchanger, which heats a liquid with a low boiling point, such as ammonia. As the boiling ammonia creates steam, it turns a turbine generator to produce electricity. A second pipe extracts cool deep water from the ocean, which condenses the steam back to liquid form. As the ammonia is recycled, the process repeats, creating unlimited clean energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This process is known as the [[Rankine Cycle]], commonly found in typical oil, coal, or nuclear power generation plants. The difference with OTEC is that it uses the solar energy from the ocean – **no fossil fuels are used in OTEC’s power generation.**
