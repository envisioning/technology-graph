>  Active metadata management is an emerging set of capabilities that enable continuous access and processing of metadata. It departs from traditional "passive" metadata management practices to enter a new era â€” one where metadata itself is becoming a form of big data, and utilitizing metadata effectively is becoming crucial for enterprises hoping to drive augmented data management and modern data practices such as data fabrics and DataOps.
