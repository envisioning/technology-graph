The symptoms of social isolation and clinical loneliness are ever more present in modern society. Based on the importance of physical interactions as a natural characteristic of humans, artificially intelligent platforms built into hyper-realistic robotic bodies designed to engage with human users physically could help alleviate the manifestations of isolation, check on symptom management, and mental rehabilitation.

Novel companion robots are intelligent bionic partners which can be personalized according to the owner's preferences regarding body type, gender, and other features. The robot has a poseable skeleton with steel joints and silicone flesh. However, at the moment, it cannot walk autonomously because it is still challenging for a robotic body to accomplish bipedal balance or fluid human-like movements. The robot includes a camera and microphone to provide solid conversational skills and resemble realistic interactions.
