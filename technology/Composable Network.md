# Composable infrastructure definition
https://www.hpe.com/us/en/what-is/composable-infrastructure.html

> In composable infrastructure, compute, storage, and networking resources are abstracted from their physical locations and can be managed by software through a web-based interface. Composable infrastructure makes data center resources as readily available as cloud services and is the foundation for private and hybrid cloud solutions.


## Why composable infrastructure?

> In addition to stability, modern IT departments need to deliver agility, or the ability to meet new business demands on the fly. Traditional IT has typically been focused on “keeping the lights on” while minimizing costs, but modern IT also needs to achieve high operational velocity, enabling the business to quickly deliver new products and services to the market.

> Traditional infrastructure solutions predate virtualization and require new physical severs and customized networking and storage solutions to support new applications. In this model, you often need to build out silos of infrastructure to support different workloads, increasing the cost and complexity of your data center.

> Composable infrastructure eliminates the need for workload‐specific environments and provides a fluid set of resources that can be dynamically combined to meet the unique needs of any application. It provides the best application performance possible, reduces underutilization and overprovisioning, and creates a more agile, cost-effective data center. With composable infrastructure, IT can provision on-premises infrastructure just as quickly and painlessly as public cloud resources can be acquired and deployed.

> Unlike other simplified infrastructure solutions, such as converged and hyperconverged infrastructure, composable infrastructure gives IT the ability to maintain physical workloads inside the exact same environment that supports virtual and container-based workloads.
