#Application 


[[Photovoltaic Cell]]
[[Solar Panel]]


> A perovskite structured compound that couples two layers of perovskite cells merged into a single photovoltaic cell. When assembled, the top layer soaks up shorter wavelengths while the bottom layer absorbs the remaining longer-wavelength light. One sheet contains metals like tin and iodine; the other contains lead and iodine laced with bromine. This combination of two solar cells can only be acquired when connected; thus, a single atom of hexagonal boron nitride separates the two layers. This single-atom-thick layer allows the top and bottom to produce electricity.
