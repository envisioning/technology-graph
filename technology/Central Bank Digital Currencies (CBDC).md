Central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are exactly what the name suggests: they're digital versions of a state‚Äôs fiat currency. But how does that differ from money sitting in a digital bank account, being used to make cashless transactions with debit cards?

Why do governments even want to have CBDCs? And which countries have launched CBDC projects?
What is a CBDC?

CBDCs are digital versions of a state‚Äôs fiat currency. 

They are similar to stablecoins, which are pegged at a 1:1 ratio with a particular fiat currency. But stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are run by private entities that hold central bank-issued cash or cash equivalents. They hold those assets so that their stablecoins can reflect the exact value of fiat currencies. 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) considers CBDCs to be a new form of money that are:

    ü§ñ In a digital form
    üè¶ Issued by a country‚Äôs central bank
    üíµ Intended to serve as legal tender

Central banks literally print US dollars or British pounds, so the physical banknotes in your wallet don‚Äôt meet the criterion of ‚Äúdigital form.‚Äù

a CBDC is different from virtual currency and cryptocurrency, which are not issued by a state and lack the legal tender status declared by the government. CBDC implementations will likely not use any sort of distributed ledger such as a blockchain.

CBDCs mostly remain in the hypothetical stage, with some proof-of-concept programmes; however, more than 80% of central banks are looking at digital currencies. China's digital RMB was the first digital currency to be issued by a major economy.
