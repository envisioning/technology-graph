A communication protocol that connects mobile devices with network operators and service providers without connecting to the Internet. It is commonly used for prepaid callback services, mobile-money, location-based content services, and even humanitarian relief.

A communication protocol, embedded in all GSM devices, that enables mobile devices to communicate with mobile network operators and service providers. Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) does not rely on 3G or 4G connection to work, but with simple handsets powered with data exchange packets. This technological solution is intended to overcome the barrier placed among data necessity and technology availability.

The USSD technology has been used to enhance access to various local and community services such as healthcare assessments, mobile money transactions, booking transportation, small group social networking, WAP internet browsing, and prepaid callback services. More recently, numerous peers are escalating efforts to deploy back-end blockchain technology allowing users to establish Proof-of-Existence, create cryptocurrency accounts, and send tokens between phone numbers.
