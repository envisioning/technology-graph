## **Bitcoin Over The Counter (OTC)**

Over the counter, trading is also known as off-exchange trading. It is done directly between two parties and allows the buy and sell off large quantities of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The main advantage of the OTC is that they handle large volumes of coins. The main difference between the normal or traditional crypto brokers and OTC brokers is the sum of transactions.
