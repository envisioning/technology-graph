A gondola lift is a means of [[Cable Transport]] and type of aerial lift which is supported and propelled by cables from above. It consists of a loop of steel wire rope that is strung between two stations, sometimes over intermediate supporting towers. The cable is driven by a bullwheel in a terminal, which is typically connected to an engine or [[Electric Motor]]. It is often considered a continuous system since it features a haul rope which continuously moves and circulates around two terminal stations.[1] In contrast, an aerial tramway operates solely with fixed grips and simply shuttles back and forth between two end terminals.[2]
