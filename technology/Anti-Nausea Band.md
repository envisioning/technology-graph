The market for chronic nausea relief runs the gamut from old-fashioned elastic wristbands with integral pressure-producing inserts to soothing over-the-counter potions to medications approved by regulatory agencies. But the origin of patients' symptoms are often hard to pinpoint and comfort can prove elusive.

Enter durable digital wearable developers. The developers of these technologies say they are convinced their products can safely relieve patients' symptoms without side effects, and are also stepping up preparations for the growth of the digital therapeutics market.

The digital nausea relief market has some anatomical commonalities such as electronic pulses of pressure or neuromodulation that target the median nerve's P6 acupressure point on the underside of the wrist, but the nascent market also shows some noticeable differences in vendor strategies. Some of these digital devices offer mature technology that has no way to quantify its benefit at scale, and some offer promising Internet of Things connections but are not yet fully defined in market strategy.
