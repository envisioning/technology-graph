SILICON VALLEY, Calif., Sept. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Nangtong Changed New Material Co., Ltd. known as CYD, the leader in diffuser plate technology and Nanosys, Inc., the industry leading supplier of quantum dot and [[microLED]] technologies, announced a historic collaboration to bring [[diffuser plate]] technology enhanced with air stable [[Quantum Dots (QD)]] to the display industry.

The resulting product, called xQDEF™ Diffuser Plate, has been enthusiastically embraced by the display industry with orders from multiple tier one consumer electronics brands such as TCL and Hisense. xQDEF Diffuser Plate is in mass production now and will be found in products on store shelves this quarter. The cost savings enabled by this simple, extruded component enables a new level of picture quality performance for TVs and monitors in the sub-$500 mainstream market.

Over the last two years, approximately three out of every four TVs sold cost less than $400. The collaboration with CYD allows Nanosys to target customers in that price range, increasing Nanosys' total addressable market by roughly 5X.

Mr. Haitao Huang, CYD President and CEO, said "I had a vision of disrupting the display industry with the most cost-effective quantum dot component when I started CYD. We have been providing the highest quality diffuser plate technology to the display industry for several years and we are now integrating quantum dot technology into our products. We are happy to be working with Nanosys, the leading quantum dot technology company, to offer this unique product to the market."

xQDEF brings together the color and brightness performance of QDEF™ quantum dot color conversion technology with the precise light diffusion necessary for perfect contrast levels in miniLED and full array local dimming LCD displays. Enabled by a new generation of "air stable" quantum dot materials from Nanosys that require no extra protection from oxygen or moisture and an innovative co-extrusion manufacturing technique from CYD, xQDEF greatly simplifies the assembly process of the display and allows display makers to design and build the most cost-effective displays with the widest color gamut coverage possible.

"Nanosys is thrilled to have successfully developed a completely new display component based on CYD's innovative extrusion process at an attractive price point for display makers." said Russell Kempt, VP of Sales and Marketing at Nanosys. "No other wide color gamut technology can achieve the performance of these quantum dot enabled components. We continue to work diligently together with CYD to evolve xQDEF with an expanded range of materials offering the same performance at even lower price points."
