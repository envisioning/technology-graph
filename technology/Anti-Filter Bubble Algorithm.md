#Application 


Algorithms that deliberately expose digital users to more diverse content, including subject views that do not necessarily conform or align with their own.

This type of algorithmic structure analyzes user interactions, connections, keywords, and [[Hashtag]] to map out their filter bubbles and then cross-link the data with their polarized counterparts. This solution could be added as an external plug-in, an algorithm update from the platform, or featured in a completely new platform focused on bursting echo-chambers. It could also be applied to music and entertainment, thus showing users new artists, genres, or meaningful documentaries and movies on streaming platforms, thus enabling citizens to think about issues or solutions.
