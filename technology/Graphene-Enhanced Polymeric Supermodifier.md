Patented High-Tech Graphene-Enhanced Polymeric Supermodifier

Gipave® is a patented high-tech graphene-enhanced polymeric supermodifier designed for sustainable and longer-lasting asphalt pavements. It is the newest and most cost-effective technology, as it improves the performances of asphalt pavements and doubles their service life, preventing distresses and reducing maintenance operations and the related costs over time. Gipave® helps to reduce environmental impacts as it contains a specific type of selected hard plastic, which is usually considered non-reusable, avoiding its disposal at waste-to-energy plants. Moreover, asphalt pavements with Gipave® are 100% recyclable.
