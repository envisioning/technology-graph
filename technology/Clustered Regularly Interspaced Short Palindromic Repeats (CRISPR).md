[[DNA Editing]]

Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is a technique to achieve precise, literal cut-and-paste addition/subtraction of genomes. It relies on two major components: an enzyme that can cut DNA, such as Cas9 or Cpf1, and the use of a guide RNA, capable of recognizing the sequence of the DNA string that can be edited. This technology makes it possible to edit genomes by either modifying, deleting, or inserting new sequences to rewrite DNA and is a more agile and accurate method than previous or competing models of genetic editing. The pivotal point involves altering original base pair arrangements within an organism's genome without the need to introduce foreign genetic material from another organism.
