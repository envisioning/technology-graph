A blockchain-based identification protocol that either restricts or allows access to individuals during critical and unpredictable situations such as pandemics, natural disasters, or violent attacks. As a security solution, these encrypted digital IDs enable only authorized individuals to enter gated communities. The access code is generated through communications tools, taking the shape of QR codes that are later scanned at community entrances, thus granting citizens access to restricted areas.

In order to ensure users' privacy, all collected personal information is encrypted and stored in blockchain-based cloud servers. In terms of cybersecurity, even the host companies that provide the service should not be able to retrieve the original data. All data should be eliminated after the emergencies are over, or only accessed if the user grants authorization to the stored data.
