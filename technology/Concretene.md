## Wiltshire firm Nationwide Engineering scores world first for sustainable construction with graphene concrete

Construction firm Nationwide Engineering will make a piece of history on Tuesday 25 May, as it completes the laying of the world’s first graphene concrete slab engineered for sustainability in a commercial setting.

Just a couple of miles east of the ancient monument of Stonehenge, the new [Southern Quarter](https://southernquarter.com/) gym in Amesbury’s Solstice Park – owned and run by military veterans and due to open in summer 2021 – is the venue for this innovative feat of building work, made possible by a joint venture between Nationwide Engineering and The University of Manchester.

### Why do we need graphene-enhanced concrete?

Production of cement for concrete in the building industry is one of the leading causes of global carbon dioxide emissions. Remarkably, if concrete were a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world behind only China and the US1, producing around 8% of global CO2 emissions.

The addition of tiny amounts of graphene – a so-called ‘2D material’ made of a single layer of carbon atoms – strengthens Nationwide Engineering’s new product, Concretene, by around 30% compared to standard concrete, meaning significantly less is needed to achieve the equivalent structural performance, reducing carbon footprint and costs.

The additional strength also reduces the need for steel reinforcement, saving material and time on site and further promoting the green credentials of this building method.  
Nationwide Engineering estimates that an additional cost of 5% for Concretene will be offset by the reduction in material to deliver an overall saving of 10-20% over standard RC30 concrete.

_“We are thrilled to have developed and constructed this game-changing, graphene-enhanced concrete on a real project,”_ said Alex McDermott, co-founder and managing director of Nationwide Engineering. _“Together with our partners at The University of Manchester’s [Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre](https://graphene.manchester.ac.uk/geic) and structural engineers [HBPW Consulting](https://www.hbpw.co.uk/), we are rapidly evolving our knowledge and experience and are positioned for wider industry deployment through our construction frameworks, becoming the go-to company for graphene-enhanced concrete.”_

Nationwide Engineering has three existing five-year construction frameworks with Network Rail and two seven-year Government Crown commercial building frameworks. With Network Rail committing to an 11% reduction in CO2 emissions over the next four years, graphene-enhanced concrete shows significant potential to help meet this target.
