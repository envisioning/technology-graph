[[Graphene Quantum Dot]]

This bio-electromechanical device is created when Graphene Quantum Dots (GDQs) are interfaced with single bacterial spores. This technology uses the cell's nanoarchitecture and micromachinery to fabricate highly responsive cell-driven devices, creating nano/bio interfaces with spores. Within a network of GQDs chemically-secured on a spore, a specific electron-tunneling modulation and force drive sporal hydraulics, allowing for the microstructure's responsiveness.
