#Application 

A nearly carbon-neutral alternative to fossil fuels. Algaculture produces minimal impact on freshwater resources and holds higher [[Biofuel]] yields. It can be used in the creation of a wide range of fuels, including ethanol and biodiesel.

Algae is the **third-generation of biofuels**, and different from previous ones, it holds higher biofuel yields, combined with the fact that large scale algae cultivation can take place on lands that are unsuitable for food crops. This opens the door for the creation of a wide range of types of fuel, including butanol, biodiesel, jet fuel, and ethanol.

Algaculture produces minimal impact on freshwater resources; as a biodegradable product, it could be produced using saline or wastewater, without threatening food supplies. Moreover, algae fuel is nearly carbon-neutral because it also extracts CO2 from the atmosphere. Unfortunately, current production costs are still too high for it to be a fossil fuel competitor.
