[[5G Mobile Network]]

Small cells are low-powered cellular radio access nodes that operate in licensed and unlicensed spectrum that have a range of 10 meters to a few kilometers. Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.

Corning's Everon™ mmWave indoor small-cell systems are designed to deliver 5G-ready coverage in high-density environments – including office buildings, factories, hotels, hospitals, and classrooms – where large amounts of data must be managed and transmitted. These systems are designed to operate at commonly used frequencies, including 28 GHz and 39 GHz, for carrier networks and enterprise network operators who are looking to bring reliable 5G connectivity indoors.
