Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of [[synthetic chemicals]] that are used to make a wide variety of everyday products, including food packaging, carpets, rugs, upholstered furniture, nonstick cookware, water-repellant outdoor gear like tents and jackets, firefighting foams, ski wax, clothing, and cleaning products. Many are also used in industrial, aerospace, construction, automotive, and electronic applications.

The PFAS family is enormous, containing over 5,000 different compounds. But only a couple of these compounds are well-studied. The rest remain rather mysterious. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are two of the original PFAS, are especially widespread in the environment, and we tend to have the most information on them.
